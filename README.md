# Fullcontrol-Airfoil

Fullcontrol airfoil is a Python script designed to generate 3D printed wings. It's a tool for hobbyists and makers to create custom gcode using [fullcontrol](https://github.com/FullControlXYZ/fullcontrol) for generating wings.

## Overview

Fullcontrol airfoil is a Python script for generating NACA airfoils for 3D printable RC plane wings, offering a variety of customizations.

## Todo

- [ ] More / better documentation
- [ ] Issue #1 and #3: Wing spars and ribs. (Spars mostly implemented)
- [x] Issue #1: Infill
- [x] Creating elliptical wings.
- [ ] Vase mode implementation
- [ ] A feature to create shapes that remove / add to the wing. For example to make a cutout for a control surface.
- [ ] Issue #9: More infill options. Maybe hexagonal, rectilinear or gyroid?
- [ ] [Add more airfoil generation options](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil)
- [ ] GUI?
- [ ] Mesh generation?
