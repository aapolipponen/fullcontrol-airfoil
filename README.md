This a project that is in a very alpha state so don't except much.

The airfoil.py file generates NACA airfoils that can be put to a set z height and their chord size can be changed. The program accepts 4-6 digit naca airfoils with no leading zeroes in them.

airfoil_loft_vase.py does the same thing as the airfoil.py except it smooths between the airfoils to create layers. This version does vase mode but at the cost of the bottom of the airfoil being flat and broken.

A lot of chatgpt was used.
